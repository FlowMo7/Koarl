# Koarl - Kotlin Open Source Android Crash Reporting Library

![API 10](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-10-yellow.svg)

An open source, self hosted error and crash reporting system for Android applications.


## Setup

### Android

Include the `koarl-android` dependency into your project.
The dependency is provided in a custom maven repository.

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            url 'https://nexus.moetz.dev/repository/koarl/'
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'dev.moetz.koarl:koarl-android:0.0.9'
}
```

Initialize the library in you applications onCreate method:
```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    Koarl.init(context = this) {
        baseUrl("https://koarl.dev/")   //<-- The URL to your backend instance
    }
}
```

After that all application crashes are automatically sent to the backend service.
Furthermore, by using `Koarl.logException()`, a non-fatal error can be logged.


### Server

The server application is provided as docker image / docker-compose configuration (which includes a MySQL database as well as an NGINX reverse proxy as well).

Copy the given [docker-compose.yml] file, replace the passwords with customly generated passwords, and start up the container by using:
```shell script
docker-compose up -d
```

This will provide the backend application as well as the dashboard, available at 127.0.0.1:80/dashboard.
